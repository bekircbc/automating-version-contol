## Git Hooks:

Git hooks allow you to run custom scripts before or after specific Git commands are executed. You can use pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards, run tests, or perform other tasks before each commit.

Example: Automatically incrementing the version number in your package.json or package-lock.json file before committing changes.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Pipelines:

Integrate version control automation into your CI pipelines. CI tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions can automatically trigger builds, tests, and deployments based on version control events (e.g., commits, pull requests).

Example: Automatically tagging releases and pushing them to your Git repository when a new release branch or tag is created.
